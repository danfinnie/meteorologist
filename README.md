# Meteorologist

Meteorologist is a wrapper around NOAA's weather forecasts. Since NOAA response is crappy XML, this library wrapper gives you nice pretty JSON on the weather forecasts that NOAA provides. And because it's really slow, it introduces a way to cache forecasts so the response is snappy.
